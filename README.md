Creating a small operating system with a shell is an exciting project. Here's a plan to help you get started and gradually build your OS:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment (DONE)** 

Ensure you have a suitable development environment set up, including a cross-compiler for your target architecture (x86_64, in your case) and a virtual machine or emulator for testing your OS. QEMU is a popular choice for this purpose.

**Step 2: Expand the Printing Functions**

Since you've already implemented basic printing functions, consider expanding them to include scrolling, cursor control, and formatting options (e.g., printf-style formatting).

**Step 3: Implement Interrupt Handling (DONE)**

Implement interrupt handling, particularly the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT), and basic interrupt service routines (ISRs). This will allow you to respond to hardware interrupts and exceptions, such as keyboard input or timer interrupts.

**Step 4: Keyboard Input (DONE)** 

Implement keyboard input handling. Capture keyboard input from the user, and create a simple command-line interface (CLI) for your shell.

**Step 5: Basic Shell**

Create a basic shell that can accept user commands. Implement functionality to parse and execute simple commands entered by the user. Start with commands like "help," "echo," and "shutdown" to get a feel for command execution.

**Step 6: File System and Disk Access**

Introduce basic file system support. You can start with a simple in-memory file system or FAT file system. Implement file reading and writing operations. This will enable you to work with files and directories.

**Step 7: Shell Commands**

Expand your shell by adding more built-in commands. Implement commands for file management (e.g., `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `rm`), process management (e.g., `ps`, `kill`), and other basic utilities.

**Step 8: User Mode**

Implement a rudimentary user mode and privilege separation. You can create user accounts and switch between user and kernel modes. Ensure that user processes are isolated and protected.

**Step 9: Memory Management**

Implement a basic memory management system, including virtual memory. This is essential for managing processes and memory allocation.

**Step 10: Multitasking**

Enable multitasking by implementing process scheduling. Allow multiple processes to run concurrently and switch between them.

**Step 11: Device Drivers**

Develop device drivers for common hardware components, such as the keyboard, display, and storage devices. This step will enable your OS to interact with the hardware.

**Step 12: Networking (Optional)**

If you want your OS to support networking, implement networking protocols and drivers for network interfaces.

**Step 13: Debugging and Testing**

Create debugging tools and techniques to help identify and fix issues in your OS. Write test cases and perform thorough testing to ensure stability and reliability.

**Step 14: Documentation and User Interface**

Document your OS's features, functions, and usage. Create a user-friendly interface and provide help and documentation within the shell.

**Step 15: Packaging and Distribution**

Package your OS for distribution. Create bootable disk images or ISO files that users can use to run your OS on real hardware or virtual machines.

Remember that developing an OS is a complex and time-consuming task. It's common to face challenges along the way, so be patient and persistent. Additionally, studying existing open-source operating systems and their source code can be invaluable for learning and overcoming obstacles.

Feel free to adapt this plan based on your specific goals and requirements. Building an OS is a rewarding endeavor, and you'll gain a deep understanding of low-level systems programming as you progress. Good luck with your project!
